## Description
React is javascript library for building interactive user interfaces.<br>
It let's you generate complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

### Creating an App 
 &#9657; **npx** 
``` terminal
npx create-react-app my-first-app   
```
> *(npx comes with npm version 5.2 and higher)*

&#9657; **npm**
``` terminal
npm init react-app my-first-app
```
> *(only available in npm 6 and higher)*

&#9657; **Yarn**
``` terminal
yarn create react-app my-first-app
```
> *(available in yarn 0.5 and higher)*

### Folder Structure 
Initially React generates the folder structures as below, </br>

 Automatically, a Git repository has been created and several commands have been added into the package.json file:<br>
```npm start``` starts the development server, including auto page reloads for when you make edits<br>
```npm run build``` bundles the app into static files for production into a build folder<br>
```npm test``` starts the test runner using Jest<br>
```npm run eject``` ejects your app out of the create-react-app setup, which lets you customize your project configuration<br>
Also, a .gitignore file have be created

 
 ### Run the App
 To run the app in development mode, navigate to the `my-first-app` folder and type the following command.
 
 
 ``` terminal 
 npm start or yarn start
 ```
 Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
